This is an example of animated portraits.
It was set up using these steps: https://www.pixelcrushers.com/dialogue_system/manual2x/html/dialogue_u_is.html#standardUIAnimatedPortraits

Make sure to assign a portrait image to the actor's Portrait Sprites or Portrait Textures, even though it will be replaced by animation.
Otherwise the conversation will deactivate the portrait image UI element entirely, and the animation will not be visible.
